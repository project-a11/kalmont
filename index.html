                    <h2> <strong> HYPOTHERMIA </strong> </h2>

                    <p> Hypothermia is a medical emergency that occurs when your body loses heat faster than it can produce heat, causing a dangerously low body temperature. It occurs when your body loses heat faster than it produces it. The most common causes of hypothermia are exposure to cold-weather conditions or cold water. But prolonged exposure to any environment colder than your body can lead to hypothermia if you aren't dressed appropriately or can't control the conditions. </p>

                  <h2> <strong> AVALANCHES </strong> </h2>

                    <p> An avalanche is a mass of snow that slides rapidly down an inclined slope, such as a mountainside or the roof of a building. Avalanches are triggered by either natural forces (e.g. precipitation, wind drifting snow, rapid temperature changes) or human activity. In mountainous terrain, they are among the most serious hazards to human life and property. Avalanches are sometimes called snowslides. An avalanche occurs when stress from the pull of gravity and/or applied load (such as a skier) exceeds the strength of the snow cover.  </p>
