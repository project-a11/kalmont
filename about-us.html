                    <h2> <strong> ABOUT US </strong> </h2>
                    <p> Formed in 1965 and based in Kalmont since 2001, Black Mountain Rescue Team is an emergency service staffed entirely by volunteers from all walks of life who freely give up their time. Black Mountain Rescue Team was originally formed to help people in difficulties within the Black Mountains. The role of the team has now expanded to include a wide variety of potential situations, where the police consider our assistance and expertise would be of benefit. The team receives no official funding and it is through the hard work of the team members that the funds are raised to maintain the service. </p>

                    <h3> GROUP MISSION </h3>

                    <p> As more people enjoy the areas around Mission, the number of calls we manage has increased. Our motto of Dedicated and Ready! ensures we are prepared for anything.  We practice four times per month year round to keep our skills sharp.  Members are trained in rope rescue, swiftwater rescue, first aid, search techniques and much more.  Some training is in-house and some is through the Justice Institute of BC which keeps all BC Search & Rescue members certified to the same high level. </p>

                    <p> We currently have over 20 members, and growing larger in numbers every year.  We are a strong team of volunteer professionals.  All funds for new equipment and training is acquired by fundraising projects, plus the support of local service groups, government funding programs, and by the generous support of members of the general public. All SAR teams in BC operate under the policies, procedures and guidelines set out by Emergency Management BC.  </p>

                    <h3> CAPABILITIES </h3>

                    <p> There are 80 Ground SAR Groups in BC representing approximately 2500 unpaid professionals on call at all times. Each group is responsible for a certain region of the province; they assess the kind of terrain they need to respond to, and the weather and mountain conditions they need to operate in. Over time, groups develop a needs assessment  based on the kinds of searches or rescues they are asked to perform, and they use this information to decide what kind of training, https://missionsar.com/about-us/ </p>
